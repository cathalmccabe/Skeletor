WIP:Some notes about the compiler
========================================================
Description
--------------------------------------------------------
This tool is intended to be used for generate *skeletons* of verilog projects.
We define skeletons as verilog files witout any logic except interconexions
amoung them. This allow us to enforce *name conventions*, *code style* and
reduce tedious *code replication* and *human error*.

Our lenguaje allows to write a *single file* that *generates all* the basic
files of the project. (modules, top, definition files & TB).

Our compiler will not generate logic, just instances of the modules, inputs and
outputs, wire connexions, and comments. 

Generated output files enforce *coding style conventions* instead of relay on
the programer.

Current coding conventions
--------------------------------------------------------
We understand that each programer or organization will have their own preferences
regarding coding conventions, We will offer more flexibility in the future.

For now generated code follows the following rules:
    * Inputs are postfixed with *_i*, Outputs are postfixed with *_o*
      ex:input  clk\_i,
    * Wires that conect two modules are postfixed with the name of the modules
      that connect. ex: wire rdy_a_d; // wiring between rdy_o of module a and clk_i of module d
    * Defines are written in capital letters.
    * Module names are in lowercase letters and with underscores between words.
      ex: module simple_example #(
    * Parameters are written without underscores and only the first letter of
    * each word is capital. ex:TransAddrSize 
    * project defines will be placed in to a file called "defines.vh"
    * All the files have five regions a File description, Headers, Modules,
      Generated logic and Handcrafted logic
        ``` 
        //-----------------------------------------------------
        // Project Name : 
        // Function     : 
        // Coder        : 
        // References   : 
        //***Headers***
        //***Module***
        //***Interal logic generated by compiler***  
        //***Handcrafted Internal logic*** 
        ```
Basic usage
--------------------------------------------------------
KEYWORDS
* build.sbt: Configuration to download Chisel and for the Chisel project
* \*.scala: File or files that contain the the description of your hardware
* Makefile: This file is optional but recommended for avoid type in the commands that perform the build process
